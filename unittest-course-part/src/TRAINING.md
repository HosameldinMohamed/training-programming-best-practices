# 1. WHY UNITTEST
UNIT TESTING is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.

## 1.1. Early debug
Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs.

## 1.2. Avoid regressions so you can refactor your code
When you have a suite of unit tests, you can run it iteratively to ensure that everything keeps working correctly every time you add new functionality or introduce changes.

## 1.3. Document your code
Running, debugging, or even just reading tests can give a lot of information about how the original code works, so you can use them as implicit documentation.  
Note that in this way the code documentation is always updated (otherway the code doesn't compile)

## 1.4. Unit testing improves code coverage 

Unit testing helps to improve code coverage.

## 1.5. Unit Testing Myth
- It requires time, and I am always overscheduled
My code is rock solid! I do not need unit tests.
- Programmers think that Integration Testing will catch all errors and do not execute the unit test. Once units are integrated, very simple errors which could have very easily found and fixed in unit tested take a very long time to be traced and fixed.

Truth is Unit testing increase the speed of development.

# 2. HOW TO UNITTEST

## 2.1. Good practices for unit testing include
- Creating tests for all publicly exposed functions, including class constructors and operators.
- Covering all code paths and checking both trivial and **edge cases**, including those with incorrect input data (negative testing).
- Assuring that each test works independently and does't prevent other tests from execution.
- Organizing tests in a way that the order in which you run them doesn't affect the results.

## 2.2. A single test
A single unit test is a method that checks some specific functionality and has clear pass/fail criteria. The generalized structure of a single test looks like this:

Test (TestGroupName, TestName)   {
1. setup block
2. running the under-test functionality
3. checking the results (assertions block)
}


## 2.3. Modularize your code
As code's testability depends on its design, unit tests facilitate breaking it into specialized easy-to-test pieces.
An easy way to do this is to use self-consistent classes. Another usefull tecnique is the so called **dependance injection**.
It is a technique in which an object receives other objects. The receiving object is called a client and the passed-in ('injected') object is called a service. tests.

With no partcular tecnique:  
```c++
class Test
{
    private:
        Database mydatabase_;
    public:
        int getIntFromDatabase(const std::string& query)
        {
            ...
            mydatabase_.get(query);
            ...
        }
};
```
With dependance injection  
```c++
class Test
{
    private:
        Database& mydatabase_;
    public:
        Test(Database &mydatabase):mydatabase_(mydatabase)
        {}
        int getIntFromDatabase(const std::string& query)
        {
            ...
            mydatabase_.get(query);
            ...
        }
};
```
With inheritance  
```c++
class Test : public Database
{
    public:
        int getIntFromDatabase(const std::string& query)
        {
            ...
            get(query);
            ...
        }
};
```



The use of the inheritance tecnique tightly couples parent class with child class. It is harder to reuse the code and write unit.  
Best choice: **dependance injection**.

# 3. GTEST
googletest is a testing framework developed by the Testing Technology team with Googleâ€™s specific requirements and constraints in mind. Whether you work on Linux, Windows, or a Mac.

## 3.1. The tests are simple

```c++
TEST(Multiplier, Test_simple001)
{
	Multiplier mult;
	EXPECT_EQ(2/*expected*/, mult.invoke(1, 2)/*current*/);
}
```

## 3.1. Use expected and current

## 3.2. Check non fatal/non fatal macro

## 3.3. Test private members

## 3.4. Test exceptions

## 3.5. Visual studio code

## 3.6. References
